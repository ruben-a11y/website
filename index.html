    <h1 class="title">A Gamer's Thoughts About Gaming</h1>

<div class="banner"></div>

    <p> <em>welcome</em> to the page of an <strong>average gamer's website.</strong> where he shall share his thoughts about gaming in general. i'll be putting my two cents out there About the devices required to play video games, The variety of video games out there, The benifits that playing video games provides, and some of the possible cons that come with gaming. As for my personal experience, I'd have to say thsat i tried both portable gaming devices and console devices. i was only able to try ready-to play games like ROBLOX on PC (which was basically one big lego-like gaming platform which also has a game creation system). so i never actually bought a game specifically for PC gaming. But will likely get a gaming PC in the distant future</p>

        <h1>Devices Required</h1>

           <p>The devices required to play video games vary from each individual opinion. It depends on earliest games that they were exposed to, The preferences of the user, availbility, cost, and user-friendliness are all factors that'd effect a gamer's choice in devices they'd use to play video games.</p>

              <p>The earliest games that gamers were exposed to, makes all the difference in what type of devices, games and likeliness where costs of devices have no factor in how many devices they can aquire. An example could very well come from one of the first video games created. such as pong or pac man. Pong is a simple tennis match. and pac-man is a game in which we've all likely seen or tried at least once.<p>

  <h3>Console Devices</h3>

    <p>Console devices are a reliable gaming device for first-time gamers. They're prebuilt consoles that are practically ready-to-play as soon as everything's set up. Setting up consoles are easy and simple. All the basic stuff you need to set it up (excluding a TV A.K.A.Television) are included with buying a console from a store. When you buy a console system from the store, a game is usually included with the console (50/50 chance that it'd be a hard-copy or a digital-copy). I find that Consoles are user-friendly by being generally easier to maintain and update games and consoles. The controllers for the consoles are simple and somewhat-easy to memorise also controllers from some stores or even online are customizable. Most of the customizations for console controllers are cosmetic designs, but there's also accessories available that can improve performance for both the controllers and console. An example is a hard-drive that improves the storage capacity of a console, allowing the console to hold more games and information. A hard-drive helps if your console is connected to the internet and a game or an app needs updating, and if your console doesn't have the capacity to update whats required, the game or app will not be able to update due to lack of space.

<h3>Personal Computers</h3>

   <p>PC gaming i don't know much about but i'll share my knowledge about it. I find that PC gaming offers more resources avaiable to PC gamers. There are pre-built gaming PC's which might be fine for a first-time PC gamer but Some of the more hardcore PC gamers can build a gaming computer from scratch, allowing them have more access to PC modifications that'd allow performance, graphical, and storage improvements. in addition to device improvement they'd have more freedom in choosing/creating game mods (in-game modifications) that can affect game-play (ex. additional weapons, companions and even brand new maps/areas), game-play mechanics and even dramatic in-game graphic improvements or changes.<p>

     <h3>handheld gaming devices<h3>

       <p>Handheld gaming devices i have some knowledge about. So if anything, it's quite convenient because it's the most mobile gaming device compared to console and PC devices. Which means that it can be taken everywhere you go. An eample would be an nintendo switch, which is one of the latest hand-held gaming devices. It allows you to play some games for entertainment on the go. in addition to nintendo switchs, there's also games on your smartphones as well. there are games such as chess, solitare availble to the people at a small price, but there are free online games as well, such as clash royale or clash of clans are among one of the most popular. Although the gaming community sort of placed it at the bottom of the gaming heirachy which makes it just barely considered a part of the heirachy.<p>
